## How to Set Up Workflows

### Step 1: Create the Workflow Files
1. Go to your repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Click **New workflow**
4. Create files in `.github/workflows/` with the content in WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES.md

### Step 2: Copy Workflow Content
See WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES.md for ready-to-use workflow code

### Step 3: Customize for Your Repo
Replace placeholders:
- `jvzhu` → your username
- `projects/3` → your project number
- Reviewer names and assignments

### Step 4: Enable Workflows
- Workflows are enabled by default once committed
- Check **Actions** tab to see workflow runs

## Manual Workflow Triggers

To manually run a workflow:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select the workflow name
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select the branch
5. Click **Run workflow** button

## Workflow Schedules

### Daily Checks
- Documentation updates (daily at midnight UTC)

### Weekly Checks
- Stale issue detection (Sundays)
- Archive old completed issues
- Documentation sync

### Per-Event Checks
- Issue created → Auto-label, add to board
- PR created → Validate, request reviewers
- PR closed → Move to Done column

## Disabling Workflows

To disable a workflow temporarily:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click the workflow name
3. Click **...** menu
4. Select **Disable workflow**

To re-enable:
1. Same location
2. Click **...** menu
3. Select **Enable workflow**

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Failed - Check These:

**Permission Errors:**
- Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` has sufficient permissions
- Check repository settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions

**Issues Not Auto-Labeled:**
- Verify label names match exactly
- Check that the label exists in your repository

**PRs Not Linked to Issues:**
- Ensure PR body includes `Fixes #123` or `Relates to #456`
- Use the proper syntax

**Project Board Not Updating:**
- Verify project exists and is linked to repository
- Check that project number in workflow is correct
- Ensure project is accessible to GitHub Actions

**Release Creation Failed:**
- Verify tag format follows `v*` pattern
- Check that CHANGELOG.md exists

## Monitoring Workflows

### View Workflow Status
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click a workflow run to see details
3. Click a job to see logs

### Workflow Report
Repository → **Insights** → **Actions** shows:
- Workflow execution history
- Pass/fail rates
- Execution times

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add to workflow for dynamic configuration:
```yaml
env:
  PROJECT_NUMBER: 3
  REVIEWER_NAME: jvzhu
```

### Conditional Steps
Run steps only if conditions met:
```yaml
if: github.event.action == 'opened'
```

### Matrix Builds
Test across multiple versions/environments:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [14, 16, 18]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Workflows Simple** - One purpose per workflow
2. **Use Descriptive Names** - Makes logs easier to read
3. **Monitor Performance** - Check if workflows cause slowdowns
4. **Document Changes** - Update this guide when modifying workflows
5. **Regular Reviews** - Periodically check if workflows still serve their purpose
